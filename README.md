![Wordle Image](/ScreenShoots/wordle_bg.png)

Wordle is a web-based word game developed by Josh Wardle. Players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word, with feedback given for each guess in the form of colored tiles indicating when letters match or occupy the correct position. The mechanics are nearly identical to the 1955 pen-and-paper game Jotto and the US televisiongame show Lingo. Wordle has a single daily solution, with all players attempting to guess the same word.
